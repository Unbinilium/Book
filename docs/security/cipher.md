## AEAD

Authenticated encryption (AE) and authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) are forms of encryption which simultaneously assure the confidentiality and authenticity of data.

The ChaCha20 cipher.  This is a high-speed cipher first described in [ChaCha]. It is considerably faster than AES in software-only implementations, making it around three times as fast on platforms that lack specialized AES hardware.
