Currently a college student, majored in Mechanical Engineering, robotics field. I'm engrossed in Software Engineer and Graphic Design, also a rhythm games player, dreamed being a freelance software developer.

I started blogging in my Junior journey, as a saying goes "Life is like a Book", I start merging my blog to VuePress and rebuild as my personal knowledge book. Otherwise, better to light one candle than to curse the darkness.

Here not only I record and share my life experience, collect every charming things which worth memorable, but also wrote something meaningful for the time. Furthermore, I aim to build this book as structured archiving of knowledge base.

Here I commit my workspace and social media, follow me if you satisfied /owo/
